# LearnKubernetes
Notes and resources collected together to help learn Kubernetes. This will eventually become a tutorial and later a blog post for praqma website (hopefully!)

At the moment, people contributing to this repo, please create separate directories with your name and put your stuff into your directory. One of the ideas is to save your notes in this repo instead of (in addition to) your computer so we are protected against accidents like hardware failures and theft, etc.
