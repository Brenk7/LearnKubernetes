# Theory of setting up an external load balancer

* It is possible that a LB machine can be setup with two interfaces. One connected to the infrastructure network, and the other connected to the network where pods are created, i.e. the flannel network. For this reason, I think that the LB will be inside the cluster network, and **not** outside the network. (Think inside the box! :) 
* This means that the LB must have flannel client service running so it can take part in the flannel network. But flannel alone cannot work magic, it's purpose is to assign a subnet to docker0 interface. That means, we are going to need docker too! So that means, we may actually need a Fedora Atomic node which already has flannel and docker both. And each LB will actually be a docker container, with two networks!?
* When we create a service, kubectl assigns a Cluster IP to it. We can take the (infrastructure) IP of the the LB, and insert/provide that to the service definition. However, the Cluster IP only exists virutally, and none of the nodes (inlucding master), have any IP from Cluster IP range assigned on any of the interfaces. That means it is not possible for any machine to learn where a cluster IP resides (ever). This means this (cluster IP) (or the network information about the cluster IP) can never be found in any routing table on any of the machines, and thus can never be reached. 
* This brings us to a point that having a LB and having it DNAT the related traffic to a cluster IP will (probably) *never** work. Instead, we should examine the service in question, extract the **end points** defined in that service definition, and then DNAT traffic from public interface of the LB to the pod network (the end points). For this , we can either use simple Iptables, or a proxy such as ha-proxy or nginx.
* This brings to the next point, that, pods may die at any time and re-created, and the endpoint information in a service definition **will** change. When that happens, the traffic redirection rules on the LB need to be updated. In the beginning, we wil ldo it manually for proof of concept. Later, we can develop some sort of mechanism, that when a service definition changes, we update the proxy redirection rules. 
* Does iptables have a capability to forward a packet to multiple destination addresses? or do I need to have multiple iptables rules for as end-points as there in a service? How will I manage that? Do I need to write some custom interface to iptable and have some sort of database to update the rules, etc?


# Installation of necessary software on the Load Balancer
Installed a separate VM with CENTOS (minimum). Assigned it the same networks (192.168.121.0/24) and (10.245.1.0/24) , which kubernetes nodes are using. (Though it seems silly to use two networks for the same purpose -- Investigate/ToDo). I had to manually add a virtual network card to the VM and assign it kubernetes0 network).

Password: root/redhat 
Installed bind-utils, net-tools, flannel - using yum.
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# yum -y install bind-utils net-tools flannel
```

My Load Balancer VM's network looks like this:

```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# ip addr show

```

Routing table looks like this:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# route -n

[root@loadbalancer ~]# 
```

I think this is silly for kubernetes to create an additional infrastructure network (10.245.1.0/24) when there already is a infrastructure network (192.168.121.0/24) to which these nodes are connected. (This needs more investigation - ToDo).


I can ping Kubernetes master and worker node on 10.245.1.0/24 network:

```

I can also ping the kubernetes master and worker node on the 192.168.121.0/24 network:

On Kubernetes master, I have the following pods running:
```
[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ 
```



My nginx pod has following basic properties:
```
[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl describe pod/nginx-2040093540-xu5va | egrep -w "Name:|IP:|Node:"

Node:		kubernetes-node-1/10.245.1.3
IP:		10.246.92.8
[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ 
```


If I try to ping my nginx pod from my load balancer, I am not able to:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# ping 10.246.92.8
PING 10.246.92.8 (10.246.92.8) 56(84) bytes of data.

[root@loadbalancer ~]#
```

So I need to be a part of flannel network!

# Configure the Load Balancer - flannel:

```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# vi /etc/sysconfig/flanneld 
FLANNEL_ETCD="http://10.245.1.2:4379"
FLANNEL_ETCD_KEY="/coreos.com/network"
```

**NOTE:** Normally etcd runs on port 2379 (and 4001) but this cluster, to which I am trying to add this (proof of concept) load balancer, was setup by the kubernetes' own setup script, using vagrant+libvirt setup. For some really strange reason, the etcd service on kubernetes master is listening on 4379 instead of 2379. Go figure!

(I used `ps aux | grep flannel` on the kubernetes worker node to find out what key is being used by the worker node to contact the etcd instance to setup flannel service .)


I restarted the flannel service, and got it running:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# service flanneld restart
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl restart  flanneld.service
[root@loadbalancer ~]#

I think you can see from output above, and have the great feeling that you should be able to ping the nginx pod now, as it has added some subnets from various kubernetes nodes! To have icing on the cake, we can now actually do a ping on the IP of our nginx pod and see if it works!

```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# ping 10.246.92.8

```
Hurray! It works! 

----- 

So now we can reach the pod just by setting up flannel on our LB , we know that we don't actually need to have docker on this machine (LB VM). Also, just for completion, here is how the networking on our LB looks like after flannel is setup.


```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# ip addr show

Routing table:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# route -n

[root@loadbalancer ~]#
```



Now, we can now have some IPtables redirects :
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -d 192.168.121.201 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.246.92.8

[root@loadbalancer ~]# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -d 10.245.1.142 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.246.92.8
```

Also enable packet forwarding:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```


OK, So trying to access the pod from my computer, using loadbalancer , does not work. I see the following connection timeouts:

```
[kamran@kworkhorse kamran]$ curl --connect-timeout 1 192.168.121.201
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 1000 milliseconds


[kamran@kworkhorse kamran]$ curl --connect-timeout 1 10.245.1.142
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 1000 milliseconds
[kamran@kworkhorse kamran]$ 
```

I can see that the load balancer iptables rules are there, and that it receives a packet in the PREROUTING chain:

```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# iptables -t nat -n -L PREROUTING -v
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

    1    60 DNAT       tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            10.245.1.142         tcp dpt:80 to:10.246.92.8
[root@loadbalancer ~]# 
```


, but it does not reach the pod itself.

```
root@nginx-2040093540-xu5va:/# tcpdump -i any                
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode

root@nginx-2040093540-xu5va:/# 
``` 

Something is interfering with the traffic redirection.

I tried to recreate the service with the external IP as 192.168.121.201, but it did not help either.

```
[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl delete svc nginx 
service "nginx" deleted


[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80  --external-ip=192.168.121.201

[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl get svc

```


Also tried with the other IP address:
```
[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl delete svc nginx 
service "nginx" deleted


[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80  --external-ip=10.245.1.142

[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ 
```

, and it still does not work.


## Here is why DNAT does not work in this situation:

DNAT is normally used on gateway routers. e.g. Consider situation when you have a web server on a private IP scheme behind a router (such as a home router). Your router has a public IP on it's public interface, but on the inside interface, it has private IPs, and one of the IPs is your web server. You setup DNAT rule on the router that any traffic coming in for port 80 should be redirected towards the webserver on the private IP. The webserver responds with a web page and the traffic goes out from the same router again.

Consider a client computer somewhere on the internet having an IP address (123.45.67.89) tries to access this website of yours through the public IP of your router, which is of-course resolved from the DNS such as www.example.com. The sees that the packet has arrived on it's public interface and is destined for port 80. The router sees that it has a DNAT rule for such situation and applies that to the incoming packet. The router changes the destination IP address of the incoming packet (destined for port 80), and forwards the modified packet to the webserver on the private network. Note that the source address of this packet is still that of the client on the internet, i.e. 123.45.67.89. The webserver sees that a packet has arrived seeking a web responce. The web server sends back a responce by using the source address as the destination address. Note that this packet now has the client's IP (123.45.67.89) as destination and the web server's private IP as the source. And, since it has the client's IP in it's destination, it will try to go out the default gateway of this private network, which fortunately is the gateway router itself. The gateway router remembers that it sent out such a DNAT packet earlier, and when it sees this packet coming back, it sort of un-DNATs it. This means that the reponce packet's source will now be replaced with the gateway/router's IP address and the packet will be sent back to the client (123.45.67.89) , and everyone is happy!.


(Phew! That is a lot of explanation!).


In my solution above, I have setup a load balancer "inside" the kubernetes network, and using that as a DNAT jump-box so to speak. When I send out a request from my work computer for the IP of load balancer on port 80, it sees that it should DNAT it to the IP address of the nginx pod. So it rewrites the destination IP address with the (private) IP address of the pod, and sends it out towards the pod. The pod only knows about one and only one private IP address it is connected to. So when it sees such a packet, it tries to respond to it and a packet is sent back using the client IP address as the destination and the pod's IP as the source IP. Since the pod can only send a packet out using it's default gateway, it sends it towards it's default gateway which is the flannel network. The flannel network's default gateway doesn't know about this packet. It does not remember sending such a packet in the first place, so this packet is dropped. At least that is the theory!

One more solution to solve this 3-way routing problem may be to use an additional SNAT rule at the LB. This SNAT will change the source address of the outgoing packet with the IP address of the LB's flanel interface IP, going towards the pod. This way, when pod replies with a responce, it sends it reaches back to the LB, instead of going out the default GW of the kubernetes cluster! [Investigate /ToDo]




Now in our situation, I am trying to reach 192.168.121.201 on port 80 through my (client) IP address 192.168.121.1  . The nginx pod should at least register/show a packet arriving for port 80. 

A successful curl directly from the LB shows packets in tcpdump on the nginx pod.

Note: The IP 10.246.90.0 showing as source IP in the packet capture above is the IP address of the flannel0 interface on my LB.

But a curl from my work computer does not give me anything, and it times out.

I also suspect that maybe some weird/crazy iptables setup on the worker-nodes  (done by kubernetes) is preventing the traffic to reach the web server pod when I use DNAT. There are many rules on a node, with crazy chains and it is a bit difficult to parse through them in a short amount of time. 


So for the time being, ....may be we can use a proxy on the LB! We reach the LB, and LB reaches out to the pods, gets the data and brings it back to us! No address changes, no packet mangling, and hopefully that makes everyone happy. 


# Install and configuration of HAProxy on the load balancer:

First we delete the iptables rules we setup earlier on our load balancer.
Then we setup a simple nginx or haproxy on lb.

Remove all the iptables rules on LB:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# iptables -t nat -F ; iptables -F
```

Install HAProxy:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# yum -y install haproxy
```

Configure (r)syslog to receive logs from haproxy:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# vi /etc/sysconfig/rsyslog 
SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-r"

[root@loadbalancer ~]# vi /etc/rsyslog.conf 
. . .

Here are the logs from the pod itself:
```
[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl log nginx-2040093540-xu5va 
. . . 
10.246.90.0 - - [21/Jun/2016:08:19:06 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.43.0" "192.168.121.1"
```



# Using iptables instead of haproxy: (aka - Like a Boss!)

So I wanted this to work with iptables (really badly), and not with haproxy, just so I could prove that this could also be done this way, so I did the following:

## First - Stop HAProxy:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# service haproxy stop
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl stop  haproxy.service
[root@loadbalancer ~]# 
```

Verify that we are **not** able to access the nginx pod from our work computer, after we have stopped haproxy.
```
[kamran@kworkhorse kamran]$ curl --connect-timeout 2 192.168.121.201
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.121.201 port 80: Connection refused
[kamran@kworkhorse kamran]$ 
```



## Create a simple iptables.sh file:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# vi iptables.sh
#!/bin/bash

LB_PUBLIC_IP=192.168.121.201

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d ${LB_PUBLIC_IP} --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.246.92.8:80
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -o flannel0 -j MASQUERADE
[root@loadbalancer ~]# 

[root@loadbalancer ~]# chmod +x iptables.sh 
```

## Run the script and verify that the iptables rules are in place:
```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# ./iptables.sh 
```

```
[root@loadbalancer ~]# iptables -t nat -L -n

This is what I get from the pod's logs:
```
[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~]$ kubectl log nginx-2040093540-xu5va -f 
. . . 
10.246.90.0 - - [22/Jun/2016:08:29:10 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.43.0" "-"
```
So the IP logged in the nginx access log is the IP address of the flannel0 interface of my LB.

Hurray! It works!


**We never lose!**

# The network diagram:

![images/Kubernetes-Cluster-With-Internal-LoadBalancer.dia ](images/Kubernetes-Cluster-With-Internal-LoadBalancer.dia)


# More notes / future work:
* So the iptables DNAT (and SNAT) works beautifully, sending traffic towards one target IP. I need to investigate if we can use multiple IPs as a target for DNAT. That way I do not have to write multiple DNAT rules for all the destination pods. If it doesn't work i.e. if the multiple IP addresses are not supported, I just have to create a Iptables "named chain" for each type of traffic and in each chain, I will have multiple DNAT rules for each individual target pod.
* Henrik suggests that instead of hitting pods from LB, why don't we try to hit the service IP from LB? That way we do not have to go through  creating a mechanism for service discovery and managing haproxy configuration generation, or IPTables rules management. This is a great idea. But there is a reason I did not go down that path when I started working on LB. The thing is, the cluster IP network is only reachable through worker-nodes and pods and that "cluster network" is not setup on any nodes, nor on LB. So the only reachable items were pods, so I took the path of extracting the service endpoints from a service and then trying to reach them instead. More observations about this are:
** The IPs belonging to the Services/PortalNetwork are not implemented on any interface on any node. So the routing table of any node does not know about the service IPs. How would we make a LB reach a sevrice IP?
**  The kubernetes master node cannot reach a service IP, even when it (the master) is part of the kubernetes pod/flannel network. Only (pods runing on) nodes are able to do so. Why? There are some crazy IPTables rules on nodes, which help achieve this. May be I need to reverse engineer that to use that in my LB?
** Make diagrams on how this whole thing (LoadBalancer) works, based on work done in this document.
